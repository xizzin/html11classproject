<h1 align=left><span class=indexposttext>1. Remember that <b>safety comes first</b>.</span></h1>

<img src="imogen/1.jpg" class=cosmosimagg align=left vspace=10% width=20% height=25% title="@spacegoose on instagram">

<p class=rulesp align=left><span class=indexposttext>Due to the existing restrictions on all information regarding aliens, it cannot be said with certainty that this or that individual does not pose a danger to your life or which of your gestures can drastically change their behavior (this may be well illustrated by the accident with Daniel Verr, famous for his advanced work in making Contacts, which is still being sorted out by CENC itself. It is not known exactly what caused the alien to pounce on him with such cruelty).</p>

<p class=rulesp align=left><span class=indexposttext>If the race you encounter does not have much press coverage or does not have a galactic translator with them, <b>DO NOT BEGIN CONTACT</b> and <b>DO NOT APPROACH THEM FIRST</b>. If possible, call the Emergency Contact Service immediately. Close to an individual of such a race, <b>DO NOT MOVE</b> and <b>CLOSE YOUR EYES</b>. Due to the dramatic differences in meanings in cultures, any movement you make can cost you your life. If contact with an alien has been made, ask their permission to record audio and/or video, explaining the reasons for your actions (detailed video instructions on this topic can be found on channels &#8220;Not Only UFO&#8221; and &#8220;CONTact: All!&#8221;).</span></p>

<p class=rulesp align=left><span class=indexposttext>It is also recommended to know a few simple, but necessary phrases in intergalactic (such as &#8216;Sorry, I do not understand you&#8217;, &#8216;I do not have enough knowledge to answer your question&#8217;, etc.) to resolve situations out of your control.</span><p>

<h1 align=left><span class=indexposttext>2. Treat aliens with respect.</span></h1>

<p class=rulesp align=left><span class=indexposttext>Remember that your speech can give them an impression of the whole Earth community. Do not use sarcasm and insults when speaking &mdash; the translator can not always grasp the first one correctly and always translate the second one too beautifully.</span><p> 

<h1 align=left><span class=indexposttext>3. Follow the protocol when transferring the collected information.</span></h1>

<p class=rulesp align=left><span class=indexposttext>Our organization stands for the dissemination of information regarding aliens and the improvement of the worldwide understanding of other races. By becoming a member of our organization, you agree to send the data you received not only to us but also to CENC, as well as to all organizations with which we cooperate.</span><p>
<p class=rulesp align=left><span class=indexposttext>Following that, we accept information sent only in the completed worldwide information transfer form (it and the instructions for filling it out can be seen on CEN&#39;s site).</span><p>
