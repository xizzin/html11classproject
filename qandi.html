<h1 align=left><span class=indexposttext>1. What are we? </span><h1>

<img src="imogen/Norma2D.png" class=cosmosimagg align=left vspace=10% width=20% height=30% title="@norma_2d on twitter">

<p class=qanda> We are a non&ndash;profit organization made, originally, with only one intension: to store and share between each other information that small group of friends&ndash;enthusiasts were finding in their searchings about the first Contact. After realising that all of us liked this format, we decided to continue running the site; not so long after that lanc, one of the current admin group, found first bits of information about second Contact, and so AAOACTS, an info blog that observed all Contact-related news and discoveries, was oficially estabileshed. </p>

<p class=qanda> Meanwhile, the spontaneously formed sub&ndash;organization of various people who helped us (and continued doing it) with collecting specific information also spontaneously became a free&ndash;entry group to all enthusiasts that wanted to become a part of AAOACTS. In 2020 AAOACTS started it&#39;s new project &mdash; a structured storage of all data that we as a community have had found so far. This project is sponsored by CENC &mdash; international researcher organization, and will be soon available to public on our new site.
</p>

<h1 align=left><span class=indexposttext>2. How reliable is our information?</span><h1>

<p class=qanda>Quite. We are always trying to verify the information before posting with acknowledged specialists and, <b>if couldn&#39;t have contacted them, we always specify that given information can be not true before the start of publication</b>. Therefore, our collected statistic for a half&ndash;
year period says that non&ndash;proofed posts are only 13,43% of all site&#39;s publications.  
</p>

<h1 align=left><span class=indexposttext>3. Why do I need to become a member?</span><h1>

<img src="imogen/planet.png" class=cosmosimagg align=left vspace=10% width=20% height=30% title="@norma_2d on twitter">

<p class=qanda>Firstly, memberships make it is easier for our organization to understand who to thank for the help! We are not only happy to appreciate your work and put your name in the credits to the publication but also thank you materially. Once a year we give everyone a chance to be gifted their personal gift package, and at the beginning of each month, we give various prizes to the 25 members who had provided information for the most popular posts. The details about that can be found on our social media accounts. </p>

<p class=qanda> Secondly, recently we were obliged* to have an approximate list of all people who have ever provided us with material more than once &mdash; believe us, it was not our choice. This list does not threaten your anonymity (if you want to remain anonymous, please, indicate this in your form when sending information) &mdash; it is visible only to SENC and has no right to be disclosed, but it would greatly help us to stay on the good side of the world organizations.

<h1 align=left><span class=indexposttext>4. How can you support us?</span><h1>

<p class=qanda>The current ways of supporting us are limited with donating to us (via PayPal), subscribing to us on social media (twitter: @AAOACTSofficial) and sharing any contact&ndash;related information you can find/gain yourself. Any bit of information helps us with expansion of AAOACTS data storage! </p>
